Model checking prototype

This repository will contain the code for an entry in the annual model checking contest.  To preserve competitive advantage, code will not be released in full until 2020.  This project is intended to be a public demonstration of techniques not found in other competing tool entries, and as a point or reference for publications describing those techniques.
